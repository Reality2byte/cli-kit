Welcome to the CLI template engine!

This template engine supports embedded JavaScript with whitespace control.

Lines that begin with `>` are print statements. The number of `>` characters determines the
trailing line returns.

With a single `>` character, you can combine multiple statements on a single line:

abc

Using two `>>` characters will add a newline character between each print statement:

a
b
c

If a line gets long, you can end the line with a `\` and continue your print statement on the
next line.

Flags directly precede the `>` print statement declaration. Here are the supports flags:

  `?` If the resulting message to be printed is empty, this flag will suppress the trailing
  newline characters.

  `|` Prevents the output from being trimmed prior to being printed. By default, all messages
  are trimmed.

Any lines that do not contain a `>` print statement are considered plain old JavaScript. You
can use `for` loops, `if` statements, define variables, call functions, etc.

Each print statement is evaluated as an ES6 template string allowing you to print variables.

This template engine is awesome!

Print statements can go inside any JavaScript block as long as it's on its own line.

Here's a few reasons you should use cli-kit:
 * State of the art command line parser
 * Template engine designed for command line programs
 * Wraps external CLI's as extensions
 * Hook into the parsing engine
 * and more!
